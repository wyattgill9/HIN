# HIN
Hardware Interaction Net (HIN), evaluating Interaction nets in parallel on FPGA

## Plan 
#### Phase #1: Defining
- [ ] Decide on memory model (BRAM, registers,...)
- [ ] Define data structures for interaction nets in hardware (Verilog)
- [ ] Design a hardware representation for HVM (IR -> HIN)
- [ ] Write hardware representation for HVM (HIN)
      
#### Phase #2: Engine
- [ ] Write core reduction engine for HIN in Verilog

#### Phase #3: Benchmark
- [ ] Benchmark against CPU/GPU
